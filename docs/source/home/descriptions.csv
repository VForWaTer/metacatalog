groups,"In the metadata sheme, groups are used to model relations between datasets. There are three important groups, that can be specified, if applicable:
- Split-dataset:  If the metadata changes for one dataset, it has to be split up into two datasets, with their own metadata. A Split-dataset group will merge the data together again on export.
- Composite-dataset: If this variables must not or cannot be used without another dataset, you can indicate a composite dataset, that will always export siblings along with the data.
- Labeled-dataset: If there is any structuring within the Project, that groups datasets together, but not in a strict sense like a composite, a Label can be used. This is usually a Site or a place name, that makes working with the data more convenient",yes,no

project,"Any number of datasets, that were collected within the same context can be grouped together by a project. Technically, this is also a group, but it does not cause any lazy-loading of other datasets and has only descriptive character.
