Guide
=====

You will find different guides and how-tos here that help 
database administrators and developers to customize metacatalog to 
fit their specific requirements. 

You will also find a section (soon) that will guide you through 
contributing to metacatalog.

We are working on opening some of metacatalog's functionality to make
it easier to overwrite some of metacatalogs default behaviors. So be 
sure to check out this section from time to time.
