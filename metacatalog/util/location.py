def get_search_shape(arg, buffer=None, buffer_use_epsg=3857) -> BaseGeometry:
    """
    Calculate a search shape from a whole bunch of arguments.
    The search shape can optionally be buffered. 
    .. note::
        Some arguments might resolve to a Point geometry. In these cases
        make sure to **use a buffer value**, at least by a small value.
        Otherwise the query will end up to search for **exact** matches, 
        which will always turn ``False``, even for the Point itself.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    buffer : int, float
        Optional. If given, the search area resolved from the argument
        will be buffered by the given value. Remind that buffer has to transform
        the data to apply Euklidean buffers.
    buffer_use_epsg : int
        The EPSG number of a projected CRS that shall be used during buffering.
        Mind the Note below.
    arg : list, str, byte, shapely.BaseGeometry
        A search area can be generate from a rich list of input arguments. 
        Depending on the data type and shape of :attr:`arg`, different search areas
        are resolved.

        - **str** has to be a WKT of type Point or Polygon
        - **byte** has to be a WKB of type Point or Polygon
        - **BaseGeometry** any valid shapely Geometry, that implements the buffer function
        - **list** has to be a list of int or float values. Resolving is based on shape:
            - ``len(arg)==2`` is used as ``Point(arg)``. Remind to buffer the Point
            - ``len(arg)==4`` is a BoundingBox defined as ``[left, bottom, right, up]``
            - 2 dimensional lists are converted to Polygons

    Note
    ----
    metacatalog uses unprojected WGS84 coordinates for the contained coordinates.
    For applying a buffer, the coordinates of the argument need to be transformed 
    into a projected coordinate reference system using meter as a unit. 
    After buffering, the search area is back-transformed to WGS84. This can have 
    accuracy implications. Nevertheless, this step is necessary, as the database 
    can then filter without reprojections of possibly large amounts of data.
    By default the argument is transformed to Transversal Mercartor Projection, as 
    this has global coverage. Unfortunately, the transformation error can get 
    massive in some, especially small, study areas. Whenever possible overwrite the 
    CRS to be used for buffering by a local reference system like UTM.

    Returns
    -------
    area : shapely.geometry.Polygon
        The resolved Polygon, which can be used to create a spatial filter to 
        find :class:`Entries <metacatalog.models.Entry>` within the area.

    Parameters
    ----------

        Note below.
